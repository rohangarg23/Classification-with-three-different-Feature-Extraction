The end model for question1 is in question1_feature_extraction_thenSVm.py file if you want to train it at
different percentage of data you can just change the test size parameter in train_test_split in line 102

The end model for question 2 is question2.ipynb you can also train this model at different percentage of data
by changing test size in train test split

61.py file contains all the end models and the combined model you can just run at it and it will save 
the predictions in the file pred_text.txt pred_feat.txt  pred_emoticon.txt pred_combined.txt and while it has
been run it needs numpy, pandas, pytorch , tenserflow,sklearn libraries installed it will also give you the 
accuracy on validation data also. for it run fine each data should be stored in the directory as given in
project

I also have provided the predictions in the name provided( when run on my system)
